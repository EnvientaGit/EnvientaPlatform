                Visitors are only permitted to register one profile per person on the

                the password to the user. The password is personal and the user must
                not transfer it or in other ways make it available to others. It is
                the users’ responsibility to ensure that the password does not fall
                into the hands of a third party. If the user becomes aware that the
                password is or may have been compromised, he/she are obligated to inform
                ENVIENTA hereof. ENVIENTA platform admins can and will change the password
