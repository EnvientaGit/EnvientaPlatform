			The initial level of product development is the community space where designers can work together to create the blueprints and protoypes of a given product. <br><br>This space allows product developers to launch crowdfunding campaigns to cover their initial expenses and investments during the protyping phase.

			The database of partners who deal with the manufacturing of open source hardware and cooperate with the projects to sell their products through the marketplace in bigger quantity or deal with third party ditstributors. <br><br> These partners may be small or middle size manufacturers, makerspaces, or even private individuals.

			The cosmo-localized virtual marketplace where consumers can find product manufacturers or distributors nearby.

		<p class="text-justify env_p my-3">
			The aim of the franchise is to ensure that members of the ecosystem do not have to develop their own brand and marketing. This burden is taken away by ENVIENTA, as partners can operate under a single brand as a single company for the outside world. 
			<br><br> Use of the franchise is absolutely free, but there are some conditions. For instance, franchise partners can only sell their products under the rules of the ENVIENTA marketplace.
