## What is ENVIENTA?

ENVIENTA is a next generation sharing economy model, a DIY maker movement and community-based solution package for the 21st century, which provides share of know-how, blueprints, products and resources for the members. It's a P2P open source platform cooperative, sustainable, cost-effective, decentralized, literally scaled socioeconomic framework. ENVIENTA is a community controlled initiative with full transparency. As part of our purpose we're operating as a registered non-profit association.

The ENVIENTA project provides cheap and well designed living for individuals, families and communities. Why pay household bills if there are existing technologies to reduce your dependencies? Renewable energy is free. Self-sustainable living requires alternative gardening solutions, based on effective water usage without dirt and farming knowledge. Custom designed interior elements made from 3D printed recycled materials can reduce industrial waste.

With your support we can build a project center, which we need for the development, education and sharing of knowledge.

You can download and share all the technical data, research and development documentation for free. Our additional plan is to set up a multi-user knowledge database to share the know-how of building a beautiful living space, growing food with the usage of 3D-printed parts, furnitures and much more.

ENVIENTA is a modular system, its future plans can be implemented within cities and outside as well. How to make it work?

It’s an open source.

Every revolution starts with great ideas. In the open source model members give their own resources, creativity, and experience to the commons. It’s fast growing and sustainable. We are looking for people around us who share the same interest. Be part of this future, now we need you!

Let’s create a world where creative minds, scientists, artists and all the people are living in sustainable and eco-friendly spaces, and able focus on other important things in their lives. That will be me, and you, but the better word is, WE!
